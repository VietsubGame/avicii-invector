00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,540
Hey! You!

2
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,400
Yeah you, hurry up!

3
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,560
Have you seen my chocolate bar?

4
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,960
I think I dropped my last one...

5
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:29,400
Hello? A chocolate bar? With almonds!

6
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:34,060
No? Okay! Never mind then, gotta work, see ya!

7
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,600
Jeez...

8
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,580
You're nothing but good looks aren't you?

9
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:55,840
A couple of bumps and spins and you start complaining?

10
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,400
I'm on a mission, remember?

11
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,760
Famous people with expensive therapists.

12
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,600
hey, even my mom has less breakdowns than you!

13
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:16,200
This is Collector Pilot H45H1M with the daily status report.

14
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,280
Smooth sailing and nothing but sunshine.

15
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,380
Well, except that I seem to have lost my...

16
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:26,160
[Inaudible radio chatter]

17
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,360
Oh...

18
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,260
Yeah...

19
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,860
But hey, nothing that I can't handle. Sir.

20
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,980
Hello? I can't really hear you there?

21
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,300
Nope, you're breaking up. Over and out!

22
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,880
Urgh! How is this cup holder not working?

23
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,660
Come on already.

24
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,980
This coffee won't hold itself you know!

25
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,060
WEAPON SYSTEM
ACTIVATED

26
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,020
Wait!

27
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,940
This thing has weapons?

28
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:23,420
Oh hai my little friends.

29
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,620
Let's have some fun, shall we?

30
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,340
WEAPONS
DEPLETED

31
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,180
PERMANENT
DEACTIVATION

32
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,440
What?

33
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,700
Out already?

34
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,760
What **** **** **** cut the budget when they built this thing!?

35
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,840
HQ
WARP GATE UPDATE
HOME

36
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,840
No...

37
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,420
HQ
WARP GATE UPDATE
ICE PLANET

38
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,820
Ice, huh? Sure!

39
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,900
HQ ordering me to turn back like I can't handle things...

40
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,300
But sure!

41
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,480
Home is where the heart is, right?

42
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,660
Euurrr! Wrong!

43
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,600
Home is a black hole...

44
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,560
That pulls you in and...

45
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,600
How hard can it be?

46
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,280
I asked for chocolate.

47
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,100
HQ sent me coordinates.

48
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,980
But I guess it's an easy mix-up?

49
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,920
I mean, in this angle.

50
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,400
the two words kind of look the same.

51
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,160
Chocolate. Coordinates. Chocolate. Coordinates.

52
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,520
Hey, it rhymes too! Sort of...

53
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,660
But you know what I really think?

54
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:24,720
I can't believe you're doing this to me again!

55
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,220
It's not fair!

56
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,320
I take care of you! Clean you!

57
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:32,200
Spend all my time with you and drive you around!

58
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:36,000
How am I supposed to go on if you keep breaking down?

59
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:39,580
Shut up!

60
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,660
Turn back like I can't handle things.

61
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:34,480
Chocolate bar.

62
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,560
I take care of you.

63
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,220
Clean you.

64
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,780
Home is a black hole.

65
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:38,840
Chocolate bar.

66
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,640
Take care of you.

67
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,480
Clean you.

68
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,240
Hello?

69
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,680
How am I supposed to go on if you keep breaking down?

70
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,240
Shut up!

71
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,000
Breaking down!

72
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:57,520
Sorry for screaming so much at you.

73
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,620
You just kept getting worse and

74
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:03,760
every time you broke down
I felt so helpless.

75
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,940
I know it wasn't, but it's a bit late for that, huh?

76
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:12,660
I miss sitting in the kitchen with you.

77
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,820
sharing a chocolate bar like we used to.

78
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,700
Mhmm, with almonds.

79
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:20,920
It's just...

80
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:27,740
I'm so sorry for not being there in the end...

81
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,900
I really thought we were done with this!

82
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,680
You breaking down.

83
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,620
Me, getting upset.

84
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,140
But it's over, okay?

85
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:46,780
I'm out. You win!

86
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:49,620
Yeah, really! I'm not even angry.

87
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,380
No, no, not at all.

88
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:55,320
Just gonna relax, enjoy the view and chill...

89
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,520
Yeah...

90
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,860
I swear I will rip every little cable and...

91
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,160
Huh..?

92
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,560
So that's where you've been.

93
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:48,120
Hey, once upon a younger year
When all our shadows disappeared
The animals inside came out to play

94
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:55,580
Hey, when face to face with all our fears
Learned our lessons through the tears
Made memories we knew would never fade

95
00:10:55,580 --> 00:11:03,200
One day my fatherâ€”he told me,
"Son, don't let it slip away"
He took me in his arms, I heard him say,

96
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:10,820
"When you get older
Your wild life will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid."

97
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:18,500
He said, "One day you'll leave this world behind
So live a life you will remember."

98
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:25,960
My father told me when I was just a child
These are the nights that never die...

99
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,700
[My father told me]
